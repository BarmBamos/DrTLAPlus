## Dr. TLA+ Series - Global Snapshots (K. Rustan M. Leino)

### Time
September 23, 2016 - 10-11:30am PDT

### Location
Microsoft Building 99, Research Lecture Room B (99/1927)
+ 14820 NE 36th St, Redmond, WA 98052

### Abstract
A snapshot of the state of a running program is useful in several ways.  For example, it can serve as a check point from which to restart the execution, in case the rest of the execution fails in some way.  Another example use of a snapshot is to detect that some stable condition, such as a deadlock, has occurred.  This lecture will discuss algorithms for capturing a global snapshot of a distributed, asynchronous system.  It will focus on writing a formal specification of such algorithms.

If you want to do or think about something before the lecture, I suggest:
+ Think about how you would write a specification of a Global Snapshot
+ Read something about Global Snapshots, such as:
  * Chapter 10, Parallel Program Design, by K. M. Chandy and J. Misra (Addison-Wesley, 1988)
  * “Distributed Snapshots: Determining Global States of Distributed Systems”, K. M. Chandy and L. Lamport, ACM TOCS, 3:1 (1985)
  * “The Distributed Snapshot of K. M. Chandy and L. Lamport”, in Control Flow and Data Flow, ed. M. Broy (Springer, 1985), a version of which is found as [EWD 864](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD864.html)

### Bio
Rustan Leino is Principal Researcher in the [Research in Software Engineering (RiSE)](http://research.microsoft.com/rise) group at Microsoft Research, Redmond and Visiting Professor in the Department of Computing at [Imperial College London](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/computing).  He is known for his work on programming methods and program verification tools, and is a world leader in building automated program verification tools.  These include the languages and tools [Dafny](http://research.microsoft.com/dafny), [Chalice](http://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/chalice.html), Jennisys, [Spec#](http://research.microsoft.com/specsharp), [Boogie](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie), Houdini, ESC/Java, and ESC/Modula-3.

Prior to Microsoft Research, Leino worked at DEC/Compaq SRC.  Advised by K. Mani Chandy, he received his PhD from Caltech (1995), before which he designed and wrote object-oriented software as a technical lead in the Windows NT group at Microsoft.  Leino collects [thinking puzzles](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/leino/puzzles.html) on a popular web page and hosts the [Verification Corner](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP2eLEql4tROYmIYm5mA27A) channel on youtube.
