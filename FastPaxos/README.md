## Dr. TLA+ Series - Fast Paxos (Cheng Huang)

### Time
August 29, 2016 - 10-11:30am PDT

### Abstract
Replicating data across geographically distributed data centers is the new norm in cloud services. Compared to Classic Paxos, Fast Paxos shines more favorably, because

-replication can be initiated from arbitrary DC (and there is no need to pump data through a dedicated primary DC);

-replication can be completed in single WAN round trip.

This meetup studies Leslie Lamports seminal paper on Fast Paxos and its TLA+ specification.
